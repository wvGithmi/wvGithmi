# Hello Folks! :wave:

My name is **Githmi Vithanawasam** :smile: and currently I am studying as a **Software Engineering** undergraduate. I live in Galle, Sri Lanka.

I love working with teams and explore new opportunities around me to build up my skills to the next level.
I love to participate in volunteering activities and writing blogs also.
